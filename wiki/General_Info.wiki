#summary General info about Lazy Loader, on-demand script and style loading

= Introduction =
The purpose of this plugin is to minimise initial loading times.

It's very easy to use:
*1) Define the scripts you normally use*
{{{
var load_elements = {
    test : {
       funcName : "testing",
       attributes : {"id" : "test"},
       source : { script: '<script type="text/javascript" src="test.js"></script>'}
    }
};
}}}
*where,*
  * 'test' is the general name of your script
  * 'funcName' is the main function of your script
  * 'attributes' are the attributes of elements which your script acts upon
  * 'source' is the source of all scripts and styles to be loaded as necessary


*2) Execute your functions*
{{{
i.   $.loader().init('testing',function(){alert('hello world');testing();});
}}}
or
{{{
ii.  $.loader().init($.loader().isNeeded("test"),function(){alert('hello world');testing();});
}}}


That's pretty much it. Suggestions, contributions, and everything else are welcome.

= Notes & Usage =
  # *funcName* must be string
  # *attributes* must be object
  # *source* must be object
  # *load_elements* is the object containing all necessary info for loading scripts.
---
  # *$.loader(`load_elements`)*: This function checks for DOM elements that have the attributes you specified. Upon finding such elements, the function loads the scripts and styles specified. *Best used after the DOM has finished loading (e.g. $(document).bind("ready",function(){` .. here .. `}))*
  # *$.loader().isNeeded(`var`)*: This function checks whether the `attributes` of the element you specified (`var`) are found in the DOM. If they exists, it will return the `funcName` for that element. Otherwise, returns false.
  # *$.loader().init(`function`,function(){ `.. callback ..` })*: This function makes sure that `function` is loaded before executing it. If the script including this function is not loaded, it will load it. After 5 (timed) attempts the script stops executing and throws an error (in console). Once the script is loaded and the function is ready for use, the `callback function` is executed.
